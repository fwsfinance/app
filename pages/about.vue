        The squeeze that flushed out the true nature of Wall Street.<br />
        <br />
        Robin Hood was supposed to be a legendary heroic
        <u>outlaw</u> originally depicted in English folklore. Yet, the
        Robinhood we have is WITH the system and not against it.<br />
        <br />
        The STONK market is rigged, so we made the FUN Coupons. It's an "exact"
        replica what Melvin received, just distributed in an actually fair
        way.<br />
